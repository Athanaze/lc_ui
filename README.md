# Simple Flutter UI kit by Liechti Consulting

## Goals

- Flatter look than Material design (limited use of shadows, no splash animations on clicks, etc...)
- Sane defaults
- Native feel : the text is selectable by default on web 

## Usage

pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
  lc_ui:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/Athanaze/lc_ui.git
      ref: master  # or use a specific tag or commit hash
```
